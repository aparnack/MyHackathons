This was a 24 hour hackathon, started at April 14th, 2018 5pm pacific time.

The problem was about predicting stroke probability given a few demographic and personal attributes. Evaluation metric was AUC-ROC. The details are in the notebook.
My solution was at 182nd position in public leaderboard, but secured 22nd position in the final score. Key was not to try improving based on public LB score, but just trust local cross validation scores and the EDA. Try exploring the notebook for details.
